      <description>Unit 2  Linear Independence and Rank in Learning  Linear independence  A set of $M$ vectors $v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_m \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is linear independent if and only if \[\sum^M_{i=1} v_i\alpha_i = 0 \Leftrightarrow \alpha_i = 0, i = 1, 2, \cdots M.\] Otherwise, it&amp;#39;s called linearly dependent. A matrix multiplication of $Aw = d$ can be interpreted as the linear combination of the columns of $A$, where the weight for the $i^\text{th}$ column is the $i^\text{th}$ element of $w$.</description>

      <description>Basic Python, comparing to Java 1    Why are we using python?   It has a large amount of better machine learning libraries.
  Useful link   Online Python compiler
  Key differences from Java	   Do not bother with a class unless you actually want to make an object.
  Functions do not need return types (or parameter types).</description>

      <description>Introduction 1  OS abstraction  Provide standard library to access resource that is valuable such as CPU, memory, and monitor. OS providing abstraction has a variety of advantages. It allows applications to reuse common facilities; it makes different devices look the same; and it provides higher-level or more useful functionality. The challenges of OS providing abstraction are identifying the correct abstraction and deciding how much of hardware should be exposed.</description>

      <description>Lecture 1 1  Functional programming  History    Based on $\lambda$ calculus
  Lisp
  ML
  Haskell
    Building block    function   take inputs as arguments and produce outputs.
  Functions are first class, like any other value. They can be passed to, returned by functions. Functions can also be combined into new function.</description>
