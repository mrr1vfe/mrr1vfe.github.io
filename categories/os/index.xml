      <description>Introduction 1  OS abstraction  Provide standard library to access resource that is valuable such as CPU, memory, and monitor. OS providing abstraction has a variety of advantages. It allows applications to reuse common facilities; it makes different devices look the same; and it provides higher-level or more useful functionality. The challenges of OS providing abstraction are identifying the correct abstraction and deciding how much of hardware should be exposed.</description>

      <description>Locality  Principle of locality  Programs tend to use data and instructions with addresses near or equal to those they have recently used.
  temporal locality   Recently referenced items are likely to be referenced again in the near future.
  spatial locality   Items with nearby addresses tend to be referenced close together in time.
    Locality Example  sum = 0; for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; n; i++) sum += a[i]; return sum;  Data References    Reference array elements in succession (stride - 1 reference pattern).</description>
